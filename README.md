# Udacity Particle Filter Project
*Evgeny Nuger*

This repository contains the Udacity Particle Filter project for tracking a vehicle.

The code was based on the lessons provided.

The number of particles chosen was initially 100 - but testing showed acceptible results with 20 particles.

All modifications were made to the `particle_filter.cpp` and `particle_filter.h` files to make the code slightly more robust.
